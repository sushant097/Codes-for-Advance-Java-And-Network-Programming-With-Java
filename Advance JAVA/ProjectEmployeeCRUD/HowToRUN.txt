For jsp-tag ; there is library inside WEB-INF/lib/jstl-1.2.jar

Note:
Out previous way of adding mysql connector as reference library not work here. Because, we have to deploy the server and all the files should be inside tomcat directory itself.
You have to put the mysql connector jar file inside apache-tomcat-8.5.75\lib  whereever you extracted it.
